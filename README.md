# DDDCalcVizir
A calculation for national calling taxes with a sort of subscription.

Below you can find the manual to installing the "app":

1.Set the given file on a local environment.

2.Open the browser and browse to the file, if you're using XAMPP, in that case would be: localhost/index.php.

3.For testing you are able to try many possibilities, but with that said I've made some test cases:

Origin: 011
Destination: 017
Time spent calling: 80
Subscription: FaleMais 60
Result:
$37.4
$136

Origin: 018
Destination: 016
Time spent calling: 115
Subscription: FaleMais 30
Result:
$93.5
$115

Origin: 016
Destination: 011
Time spent calling: 120
Subscription: FaleMais 120
Result:
$0
$348

Hope it fits the requirements for what has been asked.
